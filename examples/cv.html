<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Kabisa 2016 - Current</h3>
<p>Kabisa is specialized in developing elegant software solutions using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Java, and Python.
Luc has worked on the following projects:</p>
<h4>Signify - September 2017 - Current</h4>
<p>Signify is the new company name of Philips Lighting.
Signify is a world leader in connected LED lighting systems, software, and services.
Their innovations unlock the extraordinary potential of light to improve the quality of people's lives and to work towards a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Within Signify's indoor navigation department, Luc created a web application for the creation of mapping data.
Among other things, this app allows users to define the walkable and non-walkable areas for each floor of a given venue, align technical images and designed maps in the browser, and tiles large images of maps for efficient use on mobile devices.
The app produces ready-to-use maps in a proprietary binary format for Signify's indoor navigation SDKs for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Additionally, Luc and a colleague created a cross-platform mobile application for the Light+Building fair in Frankfurt.
This app was used to demonstrate how indoor navigation could assist retail staff during their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p class="technologies">Python, Falcon, Pytest, OpenCV, Preact, Redux, Cordova, Webpack, ES6, HTML5 Canvas, Karma, Mocha, Sinon, Chai, Ansible, Terraform, and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h4>Philips - Januari 2017 - September 2017</h4>
<p>Philips is one of the largest electronics companies in the world.
Its health watch empowers you to live a healthier life by tracking heart rate and other metrics of your cardio condition, as well as activity, sleep and more.</p>
<p>As a Java developer at Philips, Luc worked on a few of the most mission-critical micro services that power the mobile apps for the Philips health watch.
Each micro service is a Spring Boot application, connected to its own PostgreSQL database.
The micro services communicate with each other and the outside world via REST APIs and RAbbitMQ.</p>
<p class="technologies">Java, Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, JUnit, Maven, and Mockito</p>
<h4>Euramax - May 2016 - December 2016</h4>
<p>Euramax coated products is a world-wide supplier of premium coil coated aluminium.
Their products are applied in many industries, ranging from buildings and interiors to transportation- and recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>Euramax uses a number of IT systems in their day-to-day operations.
To simplify connecting these systems with each other and with external systems of, for example, their suppliers, they were looking for an enterprise service bus.
Luc extended Flux, an existing Kabisa product, to suit the needs of Euramax and developed a number of flows that solved an immediate problem that Euramax was facing.</p>
<p class="technologies">Ruby on Rails, CoffeeScript, RSpec, Java, Junit, Maven, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Docker, Linode, Amazon AWS, and Ansible</p>
<h4>Conta-Clip - October 2016 - March 2016</h4>
<p>Conta-Clip is an international producer of electrical and electronic connection technology.
Besides being a manufacturer, Conta-Clip services this technology and sells it online.</p>
<p>In a small team of three developers, Luc worked on a hybrid mobile application for Conta-Clip.
The mobile application is used to control remote equipment and obtain feedback about the functioning of this equipment.
The distinguishing features of this app are communication via both an SMS-based API and a web-based API, and the possibility to update parts of the app on the fly.</p>
<p class="technologies">Maji Mobile (which includes Apache Cordova, Jasmine, Chai and CoffeeScript), Python, and Flask</p>
<h4>Twin Archer Trading - May 2016 - August 2016</h4>
<p>Twin Archer Trading is a recent start-up that imports a variety of products from China.</p>
<p>In a small team of three developers, Luc built a business-to-business webshop connected to the product information management system Beeyond. The customer uses Beeyond to manage the products that are offered for sale in the shop. A custom Java application built with Apache Camel is used to synchronize the shop with Beeyond. The shop itself is a Ruby on Rails application.</p>
<p class="technologies">Ruby on Rails, CoffeeScript, RSpec, Java, JUnit, Maven, Postgres, Beeyond, Linode, Ansible, and Apache Camel</p>
<h4>Abacus - May 2016</h4>
<p>Abacus is a supplier of hardware and software for (online) retailers.
They specialize in omnichannel retailing, business intelligence, and product information management.</p>
<p>For one of their customers, Abacus was looking for an FTP server that was simple to use. Together with a colleague of Kabisa's managed services department, Luc set up such a server and automated the provisioning.</p>
<p class="technologies">Ansible, Webmin, Amazon AWS, Linode, and ProFTPD</p>
<h4>Euramax - March 2016 - May 2016</h4>
<p>Euramax coated products is a world-wide supplier of premium coil coated aluminium.
Their products are applied in many industries, ranging from buildings and interiors to transportation- and recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>Luc built a proof-of-concept application that enables Euramax to import the certificates produced by their suppliers into their ERP system straightforwardly. Each coil of aluminium supplied to Euramax comes with a certificate in the form of a XML or PDF document, which contains data about the product that needs to be processed and stored. To simplify importing this information, the proof-of-concept application transforms all of the formats offered by the suppliers to a single XML format.</p>
<p class="technologies">Java, JUnit, Maven, XPath, XSLT, and Apache Camel</p>
<h3>ISAAC 2014 - 2016</h3>
<p>ISAAC creates custom web and mobile applications for a number of international customers, often using open-source software as a foundation.</p>

<p class="technologies">Java, Java EE, WebLogic, Maven, and JUnit</p>
<h4>Vogel's - October 2015</h4>
<p>Vogel's is known globally for its range of mounting solutions for LCD, plasma and LED screens, audiovisual equipment, and tablets for different rooms at home.</p>
<p>Luc created a proof-of-concept iOS app that can be used to control a wall mount for a TV. The mobile device communicates with the wall mount via Bluetooth.</p>
<p class="technologies">Swift, Core Bluetooth, and Cocoa Touch</p>
<h4>Yelder - September 2015</h4>
<p>Yelder is a financial institution that offers various forms of personal loans such as credit cards using a number of different brand names.</p>
